# 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm [Your Name] — part-time code wizard 🧙‍♂️, full-time curious human 🌍.  
This is my little corner of the internet where I break things (on purpose), fix them (sometimes), and learn a ton along the way.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- 💻 Write code that occasionally works on the first try
- 🛠️ Build projects that range from *"wow, that's useful"* to *"why does this exist?"*
- 🌱 Constantly learning new tech, frameworks, and random trivia

---

## 🎨 Fun Facts About Me
- I believe `git commit -m "final FINAL v2"` is a valid workflow
- Dark mode is not a preference, it’s a lifestyle 🌑
- My debugging style: *printf, console.log, and sheer willpower*

---

## 🧰 Toolbox
Here are some of the tools I play with:
- Languages: Python 🐍 | JavaScript ⚡ | C++ 🔧
- Frameworks: React ⚛️ | Node.js 🌐 | Django 🕸️
- Extras: Docker 🐳 | Git 🔀 | VS Code 💡
